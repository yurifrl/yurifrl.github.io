Over the last few months I've seen a number of people looking for cofounders on
Hacker News or via their own personal blogs. I think this is, at best, a highly
inefficient way to find a cofounder and, at worst, a way to fool yourself into
finding the *wrong* cofounder. In any case, it's a naive approach to finding the
person that will need to stand by your side in the coming storm that we call
"running a startup."
